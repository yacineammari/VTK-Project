# VTK-Project
## vtk
The Visualization Toolkit (VTK) is open source software for manipulating and displaying scientific data. It comes with state-of-the-art tools for 3D rendering, a suite of widgets for 3D interaction, and extensive 2D plotting capability.

in this project, we were asked to read a 3D molecule of our choice and use the technique learn in our course to display the name of each atom whenever the moue hover on it. 
for that, we used vtkPropPicker class to pick the actor/prop of every atom and then display its name.
